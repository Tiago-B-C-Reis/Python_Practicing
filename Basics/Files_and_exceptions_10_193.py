# The second argument, 'w',
# tells Python that we want to open the file in write mode. You can open a file
# in read mode ('r'), write mode ('w'), append mode ('a'), or a mode that allows
# you to read and write to the file ('r+'). If you omit the mode argument,
# Python opens the file in read-only mode by default.
# The open() function automatically creates the file youâ€™re writing to if
# it does not already exist. However, be careful opening a file in write mode
# ('w') because if the file does exist, Python will erase the contents of the file
# before returning the file object.
